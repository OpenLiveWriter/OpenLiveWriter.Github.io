<h3>Does OpenLiveWriter Automatically Update?</h3>
<p>Yes.  You'll see that an update check is done before OpenLiveWriter is started:</p>
 <strong><p>C:\Users\username\AppData\Local\OpenLiveWriter\Update.exe --processStart OpenLiveWriter.exe</p></strong>
<p>However, you will not get any type of message.  You can check on the version number by:
    <ul>
        <li>Click on File</li>
        <li>Click on About</li>
    </ul>
You'll see the version number in the dialog box.
