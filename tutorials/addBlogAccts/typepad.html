<p>There are several paths to get to the blog setup.</p>

<ol>
    <li>When you first start OpenLiveWriter, you are prompted to add an account: <img src="images/configureOpenLiveWriter.png" /></li>
    <li>Click File - Options - Accounts: <img src="images/fileOptionsAccount.png" /></li>
    <li>Click Home - Account List - Add blog account <img src="images/addBlogAcct.png" /></li>
</ol>

<p>First choose the blog type:</p>
<img src="images/chooseTypeTypepad.png" />

<p>In this case Other Services</p>
<p>Click Next</p>
<p>Fill out the below box:<p>
<img src="images/addBlogAcct.png" />
<p>Web address is the webaddress of your blog.  It is often http://username.typepad.com/ or can be your custom domain.
It is usually the address of your blog's first page.</p>
<p>The userid is your login id for wordpress</p>
<p>The password is your password</p>
<p>If you check the remember your password checkbox, you will not have to enter your password again.  Not a good idea on a shared computer.</p>

<p>Click next, and if you have entered in all the above correctly, Open Live Writer will set up your blog.
<p>If you have multiple Typepad blogs, you will be able to select which one you want to set up</p>
<p>You will be asked if you want to download your theme, I suggest that you do.</p>
<p>You will also be asked for a blog nickname, with a suggestion, before finishing.</p>
<p>Click Finish and you are done.</p>
