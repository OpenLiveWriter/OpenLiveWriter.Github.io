<p>There are several paths to get to the blog setup.</p>

<ol>
<li>When you first start OpenLiveWriter, you are prompted to add an account: <img src="images\configureOpenLiveWriter.png" /></li>
<li>Click File - Options - Accounts: <img src="images\fileOptionsAccount.png"></li>
<li>Click Home - Account List - Add blog account <img src="images\homeAddblogAcct.png" /></li>   
</ol>

<p>First choose the blog type:</p>
<img src="images\chooseType.png" />

<p>In this case WordPress</p>
<p>Click Next</p>
<p>Fill out the below box:<p>
    <img src="images\addBlogAcct.png" />
<p>Web address is the webaddress of your blog.  You can find that by going to your wordpress blog and get your site address.  Mine is: https://kweaver1wordpressorg.wordpress.com/
    It is usually the address of your blog's first page.</p>
<p>The userid is your login id for wordpress</p>
<p>The password is your password</p>
<p>If you check the remember your password checkbox, you will not have to enter your password again.  Not a good idea on a shared computer.</p>

<p>Click next, and if you have entered in all the above correctly, Open Live Writer will set up your blog.  If you have multiple blogs under the same username, you will get to pick which blog to set up.<p>
<p>You will be asked if you want to download your theme, I suggest that you do</p>
<p>You will also be asked for a blog nickname, with a suggestion, before finishing</p>
<p>Click Finish and you are done </p>
