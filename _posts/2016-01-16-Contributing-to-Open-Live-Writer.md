I have been using the original Live Writer since it came out, and loved it.  I was 
an avid user of the plug-ins too.

As soon as I heard about Open Live Writer, on December 9th, I downloaded it and set up my blogs. Immediately I read the documemtation
and saw that they were looking for contributors.

My bachelor's degree is in computer science, my master's in education with an emphasis on online learning. Both
before and after my teaching career I worked in industry, most recently on a Windows phone app as a contractor. I also 
write my own software both mobile and web apps when I need to.

I will admit to a huge learning curve with GIT, but I'm getting there.  I've used SVN before, and have it set up on my own server.
While I am not currently comfortable with the code, I'm doing what I am comfortable with -- working on documenation and test plans.
The developers have been super supportive of my efforts, and one of the reasons I'm writing this, is to urge other people to come on 
board like me.  This is probably one of the most supportive open source projects I've seen, and I would love some help.

Those test plans have typos, and may be missing some spots.  That's a really good way to get handle on the whole project and I've already
even found some problems and helped fix them.

Here are some other things that people can do before they get comfortable with the code:  the best is examining any new issues, trying to reproduce
them and encourages reporters to be helpful.  I've even set up blogger and wordpress test blogs to help in that effort.

And of course, if you can code, jump in and do so!
