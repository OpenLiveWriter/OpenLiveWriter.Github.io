I've expanded my contribution.  I've been posting blog posts to the website. I've also  
created a tutorial and I will be doing more as we all get more comfortable with the process.  
I would also like some help.  
  
The Open Live Writer website is at http://www.openlivewriter.org and is maintained and   
hosted with Github and Jekyll.  

Jekyll is pretty easy to use once you get the hang of it.  I started out by creating  
my own Github/Jekyll website.  That way I wouldn't have to worry about screwing anything up.  

I installed Jekyll by following the directions on this website:  http://jekyll-windows.juthilo.com/  
which creates a web server on your machine so you can see what you have done.  

Now my blog posts are in markdown.  However, my tutorial is in html, as that is what I   
am most comfortable with creating.  I've taught computer science and web design for several   
decades and have created tutorials for both students and adult coworkers, and so that's   
the tool I'm most comforable with.  Besides, I could then use Open Live Writer -- though I think  
markdown is in the plans.
