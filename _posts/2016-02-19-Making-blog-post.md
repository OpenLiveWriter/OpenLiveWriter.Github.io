I was asked how to create blog posts for OpenLiveWriter.

Well, right now, it isn't easy.  We're hoping for tools to make it easier, but they aren't written yet.

First you need to get comfortable with GitHub and Git.  I'm not there yet, but I'm getting there.

What I do, is set up a Git Repository on my computer, open it, and then copy one of my old blog posts and edit it.

The blog posts are in _posts.  They need to have specific things in the header -- just take a look at one of the posts.

They need to have everything that is in between the ---.  Change the title, date, and author.  Then delete the post itself and write a new one in markup.

You can use html if you are more comfortable with that -- if you do, you could write the post in Open Live Writer and then paste the html in.

Once you are done, you'll need to do a commit and then a pull request, and it will eventually get published.
