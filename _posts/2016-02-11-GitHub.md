For those new to GitHub, and I am one, it's very well documented.  First a quick overview of the process.

Open Live Writer has two different repositories (a repository is just a place to store things).  One for the program itself and a second one for the documentation.  If you are reading this, you are reading documentation.

The code is at [https://github.com/OpenLiveWriter](https://github.com/OpenLiveWriter) and the documentation is [https://github.com/OpenLiveWriter/OpenLiveWriter.Github.io](https://github.com/OpenLiveWriter/OpenLiveWriter.Github.io)

The two best places to learn about Github, is Github itself.  Help is at [https://help.github.com/](https://help.github.com/) and [https://www.codecademy.com/](https://www.codecademy.com/) There is a walkthrough there.

Unfortunately if you are adding to documentation or code, you do have to use both GitHub desktop and Git Shell, again the process for both are very well documented, with a tutorial loaded into Github Desktop.
