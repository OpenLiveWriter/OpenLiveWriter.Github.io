            Now that you are familar with the issues, start answering new issues, and requesting information needed to solve the problem.  Duplicates are easy to resolve
        </li>
        <li>
            Start reading the code, there are directions in the README.md
        </li>
        <li>
            Fill out an application and indicate what project you would like to contribute to.  There are suggestions below, but we are open to other suggestions.
        </li>
</ul>

<h3>Project Ideas</h3>
<p>These are all popularly requested features.</p>
<ul>
    <li>Portable version
        <p>This would involve a fork of OpenLiveWriter so that it could run on 
            a thumbdrive or similar device, allowing the user to use someone else's 
            computer without modifying it.  See <a href=http://portableapps.com> http://portableapps.com/</a></p> 
    </li>
    <li>Improve picture service by including more picture services such as Photobucket</li>
    </li>
<li>Improve Video service.
    <p>There are currently several issues dealing with Video support that are outstanding.  Picking one or more would improve OpenLiveWriter. They include:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Restore functionality where YouTube videos can be pasted in.</li>
        <li>Restore functionality where YouTube videos can be included.</li>
        <li>Add functionality so that videos from other services can in included.</li>
    </ul>
</li>
<li>Allowing other languages to be used (culturalization)
    <p>Another former feature, requested frequently</p>
    <p>Writer has already been translated into 68 different languages, but right now only supports English! Your job would involve writing or integrating a tool to compile all the different translations of the Writer user interface from into a separate DLL. This separate DLL would then be loaded by the .NET ResourceManager. An overview of this topic is available on <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.resources.resourcemanager(v=vs.110).aspx">MSDN</a>.</p>
</li>   
</ul>
