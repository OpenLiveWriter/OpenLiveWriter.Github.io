        </li>
</ul>

<h3>Project Ideas</h3>
<p>These are all popularly requested features.</p>
<ul>
    <li>Portable version
        <p>This would involve a fork of OpenLiveWriter so that it could run on 
            a thumbdrive or similar device, allowing the user to use someone else's 
            computer without modifying it.  See <a href=http://portableapps.com> http://portableapps.com/</a></p> 
    </li>
<li>YouTube Video (and other providers) includes
    <p>A former feature of Live Writer, we need to add support of videos.  There are several YouTube videos showing this support</p>
</li>
<li>Allowing other languages to be used (culturalization)
    <p>Another former feature, requested frequently</p>
    <p>Writer has already been translated into 68 different languages, but right now only supports English! Your job would involve writing or integrating a tool to compile all the different translations of the Writer user interface from into a separate DLL. This separate DLL would then be loaded by the .NET ResourceManager. An overview of this topic is available on <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.resources.resourcemanager(v=vs.110).aspx">MSDN</a>.</p>
