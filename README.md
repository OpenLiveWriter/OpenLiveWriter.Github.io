### Roadmap
You can find the roadmap for the Open Live Writer product [here](https://github.com/OpenLiveWriter/OpenLiveWriter/blob/master/roadmap.md).

For the website, we are initially focussed on getting a fast, lightweight product homepage set up. Then we want to increase the end
user help content to assist people using Open Live Writer. [Developer documentation should live alongside the code](https://github.com/OpenLiveWriter/OpenLiveWriter/).

### For the people writing posts and news items:

All the files within **`_posts`** should have this section at the top of the file.

```
---
layout: default
title: 'Initial public release'
version: 0.5.0.0
categories: [release, news]
date: 2015-12-09 00:00:00 -0800
author: martinwoodward
download: true
---
```
Do not change the `layout`.  
`title`: The text that you want to see on the page.  
`version`: The version number of OLW about which the post is concerned.  
`categories`: Comma separated categories within braces. If this contains `blog` it goes to `/blog`, if it contains `news` it goes to `/news`. If both, then it will be present in both places.  
`date`: yyyy-mm-dd hh:mm:ss timezone (timezone is of the form +0530 or -0800, ie. +/-hhmm).  
`author` is the GitHub username of the author. Used to link to their profile and show a small gravatar.  
`download`: I'm not sure what this does but let it be.

### .NET Foundation
The Open Live Writer project is supported by the [.NET Foundation](http://www.dotnetfoundation.org).
